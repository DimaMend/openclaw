## Schedule Constraints
| Day Type | Schedule |
|----------|----------|
| **WFH Days** | Wake 8 AM, feed son ~1hr, flexible during day, son to bed 9 PM |
| **Office Days** | Leave 8:30 AM, home 7 PM, dinner 6-7 PM |

## The 4-Hour Rule Strategy

**Key insight:** The ONLY reliable exercise windows are:
1. **Fasted morning** - Before eating ANYTHING (including coffee with milk)
2. **Late evening** - 4+ hours after dinner (10-11 PM if dinner at 6-7)

## Daily Plan

### WFH Days (Mon, Tue, Fri)
| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| **8:00 AM** | Wake up → **20-30 min Peloton or indoor walk BEFORE eating** |
| **8:30 AM** | Breakfast: eggs + black coffee (add milk after workout) |
| **9:00 AM** | Feed son |
| **12:30 PM** | Lunch (protein-heavy) |
| **4:30+ PM** | Optional: 15-20 min walk/light dumbbells (if 4hrs since lunch) |
| **6:30 PM** | Dinner |
| **9:00 PM** | Son to bed |
| **9:15 PM** | **DANGER ZONE** - No snacking. Herbal tea, water, or go to bed early |
| **10:30 PM** | If still up & 4hrs post-dinner: optional light stretching/yoga |

### Office Days (Wed, Thu)
| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| **7:45 AM** | Wake → **15-20 min quick Peloton or bodyweight circuit FASTED** |
| **8:10 AM** | Quick breakfast, leave by 8:30 |
| **During day** | Take stairs, walk during calls if possible |
| **7:00 PM** | Home, dinner |
| **9:00 PM** | Son to bed |
| **9:15 PM** | **No snacking** - same as WFH |

## Snacking Strategy (The Real Battle)

**Problem:** 9 PM - 12 AM boredom/exhaustion eating (chocolate, chips & dip)

**Solutions:**
1. **Go to bed earlier** - Exhaustion snacking = your body wants sleep, not food
2. **Brush teeth at 9 PM** - Psychological "kitchen closed" signal
3. **Allowed evening items:** Herbal tea, sparkling water, sugar-free jello
4. **Controlled chocolate:** 1-2 squares dark chocolate (70%+) RIGHT after dinner, then done
5. **Remove chips from house** - Can't eat what's not there

## Nutrition Guidelines

**Breakfast:** ✅ Eggs or Greek yogurt + coffee (good protein start)

**Lunch/Dinner focus:**
- High protein (chicken, fish, beef, eggs)
- Vegetables (since no fruits allowed)
- Moderate carbs (rice, potatoes, bread - not unlimited)

**Chocolate compromise:**
- Dark chocolate (70%+) has less sugar
- 1-2 squares after dinner = ~50-100 cal
- NO chocolate after 8 PM

## Why Deficit Isn't Working (Probably)

1. **Late night snacking underestimated** - Chips & dip + chocolate = 500-1000 invisible calories
2. **Liquid calories** - How much milk in coffee? Multiple coffees?
3. **Weekend eating** - Different pattern?
4. **Need more time** - If truly in deficit, results will come

## Weekly Workout Schedule

| Day | Workout | Duration |
|-----|---------|----------|
| Mon | Peloton (moderate) | 25-30 min fasted AM |
| Tue | Dumbbells (strength) | 20-25 min fasted AM |
| Wed | Quick Peloton | 15-20 min fasted AM (office day) |
| Thu | Bodyweight circuit | 15-20 min fasted AM (office day) |
| Fri | Peloton (longer ride) | 30-40 min fasted AM |
| Sat | Rest or light walk | Flexible |
| Sun | Yoga/stretching + walk | 30 min |

## Tracking

### Weight Log
| Date | Weight | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 2026-01-21 | ~240 | Starting plan |

### Weekly Check-in
- Monday: Weigh-in, review week
- Track: workouts completed, late-night snacking incidents

---

## Remember
- **Something > Nothing** - 15 min fasted is better than 0
- **Sleep is weight loss** - Tired = cravings + cortisol
- **The snacking is the problem** - Fix 9 PM-12 AM and weight will move
