## Day 1: Inversion (Ready for 2026-01-22)

**The Model:** Instead of asking "How do I succeed?", ask "What would guarantee failure? Now avoid that."

**Munger quote:** "Invert, always invert."

**Question for Anthony:**
You're building ProphetX and want it to succeed. Invert it: What are 3-5 things that would *guarantee* ProphetX fails?
