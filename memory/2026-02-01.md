## 2026-02-01

- **Configuration Change:** David requested to change the default Telegram group policy. I updated the gateway configuration so that I will respond to all messages in groups, not just mentions (`requireMention: false`).
- **Heartbeat Task Removed:** Per David's request, I've stopped working on the Agent Console rebuild as my default heartbeat task. The `HEARTBEAT.md` file is now set to `HEARTBEAT_OK`, and I will focus on proactive checks (email, calendar, etc.) during heartbeats.
- **New Agents Created:** The 12:00 sync included the creation of two new agent definitions in the workspace: `savestate-sally` and `undercover-andy`.
- **Model Identity:** Clarified for David that my primary model is `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5` and explained how he would be notified if a fallback model is used (either by me announcing it or via the `session_status` tool).
- **Agent Workspace Restructuring:** Per David's clarification, I moved the newly created agents (`meshguard-matt`, `savestate-sally`, `undercover-andy`) from the `clawd/agents/` collection to their own top-level directories (`/Users/steve/meshguard-matt`, etc.) to reflect their status as independent entities. I also updated the gateway configuration (`openclaw.json`) to point to these new locations.
- **MeshGuard Matt Onboarded:** David provided a Telegram token for MeshGuard Matt. I updated the gateway configuration to add his account and binding, allowing him to respond to Telegram chats.
- **Backup Protocol Established:** After David reminded me of the importance of backing up configuration changes, I established a new standard operating procedure: before editing `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`, I will now automatically create a timestamped backup of the file in `~/.openclaw/backups/`. I created the first backup of the file containing Matt's configuration.
- **Gateway Restarts:** David prefers to restart the gateway manually after configuration changes. I will not attempt to restart the gateway automatically in the future unless explicitly granted permission via the `commands.restart` config setting.

## Twenty CRM Project Management - Late Night Session

### Projects Object Reactivated & Extended

The `project` object already existed in Twenty but was deactivated. Fixed via REST Metadata API:

```bash
PATCH https://api.mollified.app/rest/metadata/objects/{id}
{ "isActive": true, "description": "...", "icon": "IconFolder" }
```

**New Custom Fields Added:**
- **Status** (SELECT): Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, Done, Cancelled
- **Priority** (SELECT): Low, Medium, High, Urgent  
- **Type** (SELECT): Feature, Bug Fix, Infrastructure, Documentation, Marketing, Operations
- **Description** (TEXT)
- **Start Date** (DATE)
- **Due Date** (DATE)

**New Relations Added:**
- **Company** (MANY_TO_ONE) - link projects to customers
- **Owner** (MANY_TO_ONE → Person) - assign project ownership

### Technical Learnings
- GraphQL metadata API returns "Forbidden resource" with API keys - use REST metadata API instead
- REST metadata works fine: `https://api.mollified.app/rest/metadata/*`
- SELECT field values must be UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., "IN_PROGRESS" not "in_progress")
- Fields are created with `POST /rest/metadata/fields`
- Relations are created with `POST /rest/metadata/relations`

### Correct Startup Domains (from Bear/AGENTS.md)
| Startup | Domain | CEO |
|---------|--------|-----|
| MeshGuard | meshguard.app | Matt |
| SaveState | savestate.dev | Sally |
| UndercoverAgent | undercoveragent.ai | Andy |

### Next Steps
- [ ] Create Twenty workspaces for Sally and Andy (David)
- [ ] Spin up Chatwoot at support.mollified.app (multi-tenant for all 3 startups)
- [ ] Gateway restart for agents to pick up new CRM skills
- [ ] OpenAI Codex auth tomorrow (`openclaw models auth login --provider openai-codex`)

## Chatwoot Deployment - Late Night

**Deployed:** support.mollified.app (multi-tenant for all 3 startups)

**Server:**
- DigitalOcean droplet: `chatwoot` (ID: 548839219)
- IP: **165.22.184.207**
- Size: s-1vcpu-2gb ($12/mo)
- 2GB swap added

**Stack:**
- Chatwoot (Rails + Sidekiq)
- Postgres (pgvector/pgvector:pg16)
- Redis
- Caddy (reverse proxy, auto-HTTPS)

**Files:** `/opt/chatwoot/` on the droplet
- docker-compose.yaml
- .env (with generated secrets)
- Caddyfile

**DNS Required (David):**
```
A record: support.mollified.app → 165.22.184.207
```

**Next Steps After DNS:**

2. Create super admin account
3. Create 3 organization accounts:
   - MeshGuard (support@meshguard.app)
   - SaveState (support@savestate.dev)
   - UndercoverAgent (support@undercoveragent.ai)
4. Configure chat widgets for each startup's website
5. Set up SMTP for email notifications
