## Bear Notes - Correct Method

**Don't use grizzly CLI** for creating Bear notes - it has encoding issues (+ signs between characters).

**Use instead:** `~/clawd/scripts/bear-create.sh`
```bash
~/clawd/scripts/bear-create.sh "Title" "tag1,tag2" < content.md
```

This uses Python's `urllib.parse.quote(text, safe='')` for proper URL encoding and opens Bear via x-callback-url.

## MeshGuard Business Model Decision

**Decision:** Option A - Proprietary SaaS (not open core)

**Reasoning:** David's experience with Mautic (open core) was difficult. Keeping core proprietary is simpler.

**Model:**
- Core gateway code: **Private** (dbhurley/meshguard)
- Python SDK: **Public** (pip install meshguard)
- Documentation: **Public** (docs.meshguard.app)
- Revenue: 100% from hosted service
- Enterprise: On-prem available via custom agreement

**Docs updated to:**
- Remove self-hosted/Docker installation guides
- Focus on SDK usage + hosted service
- Add enterprise page for on-prem inquiries
